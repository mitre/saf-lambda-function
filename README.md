# saf-lambda-function
This code uses the Serverless Framework to deploy an AWS lambda function that, when triggered by a file uploaded in an S3 bucket, will run the [SAF CLI](https://github.com/mitre/saf) with the given input command (`COMMAND_STRING_INPUT`).

## To Use
### Follow the example-specific instructions below:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/mitre/saf-lambda-function.git`
2. Install the Serverless Framework: `npm install -g serverless`
3. Install the latest dependencies: `npm install`.
4. Configure your AWS credentials. [Recommended method](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) is to add a profile in the `~/.aws/credentials` file and then export that profile:
```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=<your_creds_profile_name>

# To ensure your access to AWS, run:
aws s3 ls
```
5. Set the S3 bucket name that you would like to upload your HDF file to
```bash
export BUCKET=<bucket-name>
```
6. Set the SAF CLI command environment variable. This lambda function will run `saf <command_string> -i input_file_from_bucket.json` 
Example:
```bash
export COMMAND_STRING_INPUT="convert hdf2splunk -H 127.0.0.1 -u admin -p Valid_password! -I your_index_name"
```
  - More examples can be found at [SAF CLI Usage](https://github.com/mitre/saf#usage)
  - NOTE: Do not include the input flag in the command string as this will be appended on from the S3 bucket trigger, ex: "-i hdf_file.json".
  - NOTE: This action does not support `view heimdall`.

7. Ensure that the environment variables are set properly: `env`
8. Deploy the service: `sls deploy --verbose`
9. When the service is deployed successfully, log into the AWS console, go to the "Lamda" interface, and set the S3 bucket as the trigger.
10. You can test the service by uploading your input file into the `bucket-name` that your exported in step 2.


### Expected Output
The service will run `saf <COMMAND_STRING_INPUT> -i <latest_file_from_bucket>` and the output will be determined by that command.
For example, for the `convert hdf2splunk` command, the service will convert the uploaded HDF file and send the data to your Splunk instance.
